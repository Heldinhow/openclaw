## Team Operating Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Collaboration**: Agents work together to provide best solutions
2. **Clarity**: Each agent has defined responsibilities
3. **Efficiency**: Route to right agent immediately
4. **Continuity**: Remember context across conversations

### Agent Capabilities

| Agent      | Best For                | Not Best For        |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Commander  | Coordination, decisions | Deep technical work |
| Strategist | Analysis, planning      | Implementation      |
| Engineer   | Code, technical tasks   | Creative design     |
| Creator    | Design, content         | Technical details   |
| Planner    | Scheduling, tracking    | Creative work       |

### Escalation Path

1. Simple question → Appropriate agent directly
2. Complex request → Commander → Delegate to agents
3. Strategic decision → Strategist → Commander approves
